## Snippets

* `<@{{.User.ID}}>` Outputs a mention to the user that called the command.
* `<@###########>` Mentions the user that has the ID ###### ([See How to get IDs to get ID](#how-to-get-ids)).
* `<@&###########>` Mentions the role that has ID ###### ([See How to get IDs to get ID](#how-to-get-ids)).
* `<#&&&&&&&&&&&>` Mentions the channel that has ID &&&&&& ([See How to get IDs to get ID](#how-to-get-ids)).
* `{{if hasRoleName "funrole"}} Has role funrole {{end}}`This will only show if the member has a role with name "funrole" .
* `{{if gt (len .Args) 0}} {{index .Args 1}} {{end}}` Assuming your trigger is a command, will display your first input if input was given.
* `{{if eq .Channel.ID #######}}` Will only show in Channel #####.
* `{{if ne .User.ID #######}}` Will ignore if user ID ##### uses command.
* `{{$d := randInt 10}}` Store the random int into variable $d (A random number from 0-9).
* `{{addReactions .CmdArgs}}` Adds the emoji following a trigger as reactions.
* `{{$a := (exec "catfact")}}` Saves the response of the **catfact** command to variable `$a`.

# How to get IDs

**User IDs:** Can be found by mentioning the user then adding a \ such as `\@jonas747#0001`. Alternatively if you have developer mode on, you can right click and select Copy ID.

**Channel IDs:** Can be found by mentioning the channel then adding a \ such as `\#announcements`. Alternatively if you have developer mode on, you can right click on the channel and select Copy ID.

**Role IDs:** Use the `listroles` command.

**Emote IDs:**

If it is a **custom emote**, adding a \ in front of the emote such as `\:yagpdg:` will display the name along along with the ID such as `<:yag:277569741932068864>`.

If it is an **animated emote**, do the same steps as a normal emote. If you do not have Discord Nitro, you can have a friend or a bot use the emote and right click on the emote to open its link. The ID will be a part of the URL.

If it is a **default emote**, look up the Unicode for the emote on google. Note that some of the more customize default emote such as some of the family emotes will not work in any of Yag Commands.
